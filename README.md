# SNHU-CS-305-Software-Security
This is my work from my CS-305 class at SNHU

•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial company looking to increase their security to ensure their clients data is safe. They also want to comply with all governmental regulations and use the best coding practices.
•	What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
When I found vulnerabilities in the software I researched what steps were needed to resolve the issue. A lot of the vulnerabilities found could be resolved by using updated versions of software. It is important to code securely to protect the system from malicious attackers and data breaches.
•	Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The main issue I had with the projects was the compatibility issues I ran into. I had to do a decent amount of research to figure out what version of java and other programs I needed to install.
•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
In the assignments I modified the .pom file to complete OWASP dependency checks as well as suppressing false positives from the list of vulnerabilities. I also used SHA-256 to implement secure hashing.
•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I tested the software a lot during the development process. After I was done I ran OWASP vulnerability checks to make sure I did not introduce any new known vulnerabilities.
•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used a lot of resources online and a lot of them are in my submission as sources. The OWASP website was helpful as well as the help feature on Eclipse.
•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would say this assignment is the perfect example of something that I had no knowledge of going into the class and really had to do a ton of research to figure everything out.
